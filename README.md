# Rust/Pong/Amethyst

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/armyofevilrobots/rust-pong-amethyst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/armyofevilrobots/rust-pong-amethyst)


Just a quick little repo where I follow their tutorial and refactor it a bit.
The intent here is to get a handle on ECS and to get a better understanding of non-trivial rust lifetimes.
Also want to prep to write a bit more complex roguelike that I can use as a place to experiment with
rust in more detail, and maybe even build a working game.

The tutorial I am following is here: [Amethyst Pong Tutorial](https://www.amethyst.rs/book/latest/intro.html).

The build is automated through Travis CI, and generates binaries, but doesn't
push them anywhere yet.

TODO:
 - Binaries pushed to github releases
 - Build for OSX as well as Linux... Windows?
